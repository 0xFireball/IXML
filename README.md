# IXML

An extensible markup language. A partial reimplementation of Jade/Pug. Far more concise than XML

## About

**IXML** is based on my previous work on [KJade](https://github.com/0xFireball/KJade), which could compile a subset of Jade/Pug to XML.
IXML is a more generalized and improved version of KJade.
